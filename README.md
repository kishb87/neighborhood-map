# neighborhood-map

This application allows you to find all the restaurants that serve tacos in a city. It uses the yelp API with "city name" + "tacos" as a paramter. The app then takes the information from the API to populate the information using knockout.js. 

HOW TO USE IT
Just enter a city name and hit enter!
